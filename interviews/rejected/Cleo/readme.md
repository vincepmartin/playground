Cleo Interview Question
---------------
Primarily I am a Java/Kotlin developer in my day to day.  However, since the spec.md included stated that you primarily work with Javascript and Python I decided to try my hand at a javascript solution.

How To Run
---------------
This was written in Javascript and can be run with the following command.

`node solution.js`

Running this command will read an input.txt file and then convert the valid records to a CLEO compatible JSON file called output.txt.  Output will also be written to the screen.

Included Files
---------------
`solution.js`: The driver program for the solution
`cleopackage.js`: An object used to store individual Cleo Packages
`cleopackagebundler.js`: An object used to account for multiple Cleo Packages as defined in cleopackage.js
