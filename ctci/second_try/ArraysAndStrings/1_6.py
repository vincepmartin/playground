String compression:
Implement a method to perform basic string compresion using te counts of repeated chars.

For example:
aabcccccaaa becomes a2b1c5a3

If the compressed version of the string is in reality longer than the non compressed version just return
the non compressed version!

Summary:
I think this is O(N) in terms of space and is O(1) in terms of the storage being used.
